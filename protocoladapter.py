"""
The ProtocolAdapterFactory creates a ProtocolAdapter for each new connection.
For a client endpoint, a ProtocolAdapterFactory is passed on the connect call
and its buildProtocol method is called when the connection is established.  For
a server endpoint, a ProtocolAdapterFactory is passed on the listen call
and its buildProtocol method is called when a new connection is accepted.

On the receive side, the ProtocolAdapter interfaces with a receiver to transfer
data delivered by the reactor.  When the reactor calls the ProtocolAdapter's
dataReceived method, the ProtocolAdapter asks the receiver for a buffer in
which to place the data, copies the data to the buffer and notifies the
receiver that bytes have been received.  It repeats this until all the
received data has been passed on to the receiver.  It also notifies the
receiver if the connection is lost.

A receiver must implement the functions rx_bytes() and connection_lost().

On the send side, the ProtocolAdapter simply passes on the string of bytes
presented to it to the transport.

Then name of the ProtocolAdapter reflects the effort to integrate the twisted
framework into the existing BitTorrent structure.
